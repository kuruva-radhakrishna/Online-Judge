## Setup & Installation

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Code\ Arena
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Create `.env` files in `Backend/` and `Compiler Server/` with the following variables:

#### Backend/.env
- `PORT`: The port for the backend server to listen on.
- `MONGOOSE_URL`: MongoDB connection string for the backend database.
- `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL where the frontend is hosted (for CORS).
- `FRONTEND_URL_LOCAL`: Localhost URL for frontend (for CORS during development).
- `COMPILER_URL`: The URL where the compiler server is running.
- `Gemini_api`: API key for Google Gemini (AI code review/debug).
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret string for session encryption.

#### Compiler Server/.env
- `PORT`: The port for the compiler server to listen on.
- `MONGOOSE_URL`: MongoDB connection string for the compiler server (if needed).

> **Note:** Adjust variable names and values as needed for your deployment environment.

### 3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd Backend
npm install

cd ../Compiler\ Server
npm install

cd ../Frontend
npm install
```

### 4. **Start the servers**

- **Backend**:  
  ```bash
  cd Backend
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Compiler Server** (recommended: use Docker):  
  ```bash
  cd Compiler\ Server
  docker build -t codearena-compiler .
  docker run -p <your-compiler-port>:<your-compiler-port> codearena-compiler
  ```
  Or run locally:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- **Frontend**:  
  ```bash
  cd Frontend
  npm run dev
  ```
